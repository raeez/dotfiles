<## It doesn't "fail". It has the same effect as executing any non-ssh command with arguments. The OP wasn't asking for a lesson in double escaping arguments. Just how to get his second command to execute what [whatever] argument he was already intending.  Ted Bigham Jan 19 '15 at 18:09

<## If the user asks how to execute something over ssh, then it's reasonable to expect any answer to cover caveats specific to ssh (ie. which don't exist when running code locally). Double expansion (and shell injection vulnerabilities caused by same) are among such caveats which wouldn't exist with cd testdir; ./test.sh "$1" run directly in a local shell, but do exist with the code as-given.
